'on_delete=models.SET_NULL' means when a Topic is deleted, don't delete the Room instead, just set the Topic of the related Room to NULL (i.e. empty/no topic) and 'null=True' means that 'topic' field in the database can be NULL. If 'null=True' is not set then django will not allow a NULL value in this field and will throw an error.

    # 'null=True' is for database and 'blank=True' is for save method like when we are adding the form

    updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    # updated and created are similar but the difference between auto_now and auto_now_add is that auto_now takes the timestamp every time we save the item but auto_now_add only takes the timestamp when we FIRST save or create this instance
    # so if we save it multiple times 'created' value will never change because of auto_now_add but 'updated' value will change everytime because of auto_now
